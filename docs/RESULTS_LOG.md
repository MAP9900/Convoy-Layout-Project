## Test 1 - Baseline vs RL (2026-03-31)

- Baseline run:
  - `results/runs/baseline/20260331_005947_baseline_test1`
  - `static_baseline.expected_hits = 2.7`
  - `heuristic_baseline.expected_hits = 2.2` (winner)
- RL run:
  - `results/runs/rl/20260331_005922_rl_test1`
  - `evaluation.expected_hits = 2.7`
  - `training.selected_action = staggered_mid`

### Conclusion

- RL matched static baseline (`2.7`) but underperformed heuristic baseline (`2.2`).
- Relative gap vs heuristic baseline: `+0.5` expected hits (~18.5% worse than 2.7->2.2 benchmark).

### Validity Notes

- Train/eval profile splits matched across runs.
- Train/eval seeds matched across runs:
  - Train seeds: `[1939, 1940, 1941]`
  - Eval seeds: `[1942, 1943, 1944]`
- This Test 1 result is a valid 1 to 1 comparison.
